📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is an enterprise-level full-stack application designed to process, clean and visualize Mobile Money (M0MO) transaction data. 
The system extracts data from XML SMS, categorizes transactions (e.g sent, recieved, payments) using a Pyhton-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, stores them in a relational MYSQL database and presents insights via a web-based front-end display.
